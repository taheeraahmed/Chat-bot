# Chat-bot
Trying to make different types of chat-bots 

## Alien bot 
This is a rule-based chat bot. The bot is supposed to be an alien which has been abolished from it's own civilization and needs a new home. It want's to gain more information about "Earth".
It can also cube numbers if you ask it to :) 

It's a quite simplistic approach to a chat bot and only uses if-elif-else statements to match different regular expressions to different intents.
